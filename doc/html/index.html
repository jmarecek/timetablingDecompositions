<h1>Memos Solvers: Decomposition, Reformulation, and Diving</h1>

Overview</a></h2>
In many real-life optimisation problems, there are multiple interacting components in a solution. For example, different components might specify assignments to different kinds of resource. Often, each component is associated with different sets of soft constraints, and so with different measures of soft constraint violation. The goal is then to minimise a linear combination of such measures.<p>
In the multiphase exploitation of multiple objective-/value-restricted submodels (MEMOS) approach of Burke et al. (2009), only one computationally difficult component of a problem and the associated subset of objectives is considered at first. This produces partial solutions, which define interesting neighbourhoods in the search space of the complete problem. Often, it is possible to pick the initial component so that variable aggregation can be performed at the first stage, and the neighbourhoods to be explored next are guaranteed to contain feasible solutions. Using integer programming, it is then easy to implement heuristics producing solutions with bounds on their quality.<p>
The sample solver is for university course timetabling problem used in the 2007 International Timetabling Competition, also known as the <a class="el" href="namespace_udine.html">Udine</a> Course Timetabling Problem. The goal is to find an assignment of events to periods and rooms, so that the assignment of events to periods is a feasible bounded colouring of an associated conflict graph and the linear combination of the numbers of violations of four soft constraints is minimised. In the proposed heuristic, an objective- -restricted neighbourhood generator produces assignments of periods to events, with decreasing numbers of violations of two period-related soft constraints. Those are relaxed into assignments of events to days, which define neighbourhoods that are easier to search with respect to all four soft constraints. Integer programming formulations for all subproblems are given and evaluated using ILOG CPLEX 11.</div>
